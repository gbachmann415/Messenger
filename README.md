# Messenger

## Project Overview
- Parallel and Distributed Systems Project
- Program to use public key encryption to send secure messages to other users. 
- This is a distributed system where keys will be stored on a server and we will be able to send secure messages to others using only their email address.

## Further Description
- Use of network protocols to be able to send secure messages to other people and decode messages sent to you.
- Use of a prior prime number generation class that I had written, and slightly modified to work best in this program.
- RSA Encryption.
- Command line driven.
